This is an extremely minimalist vim colorscheme (almost no syntax highlighting).

To use:
- :colo nofrils-dark
- :colo nofrils-light

To customize:
- :let g:nofrils_strbackgrounds=1 to turn highlighted string backgrounds
- :let g:nofrils_heavycomments=1 to turn on high contrast comments rather than the default faded style

The only highlighted elements are spelling, errors, comments, vim features (diff, etc) and *optionally* string backgrounds

Dark and light screenshot of the colorscheme with **:let g:nofrils_strbackgrounds=1** (with this off, the default, background of strings is same as normal background).  The pink(ish) highlight is for misspellings.
